# rust-wasm

## Quick start with Docker

```
$ docker run --rm --runtime=io.containerd.wasmedge.v1 --platform=wasi/wasm secondstate/rust-example-hello:latest
Hello WasmEdge!
```

## Code

The [`src/main.rs`](src/main.rs) source code shows

* A standalone Rust app must have a `main()` function as the entry point.
* In the `main()` function, we create a string. The string is `&str` type. In Rust, it is called a string slice meaning that this string is immutable.
* We print the string using the `println!()` marco. The `!` indicates that it is a macro, which is a set of functions to perform the task of printing to the OS console. The Rust compile expands the macro into a set of functions at compile time. There are many such macros in Rust and it is crucial that you learn them!

## Step by step guide

Compile the Rust source code project to a Wasm bytecode file.

```
$ cargo build --target wasm32-wasi --release
```

Run the Wasm bytecode file in WasmEdge CLI.

```
$ wasmedge target/wasm32-wasi/release/hello.wasm
Hello WasmEdge!
```

## Build and publish on Docker

The `Dockerfile` follows the above steps to build and package a lightweight OCI-compliant container image for the Wasm app.
Now, we need to publish the container image to Docker Hub.
You just need to specify that the WasmEdge application image is for the `wasi/wasm` platform.

```
$ docker buildx build --provenance=false --platform wasi/wasm -t secondstate/rust-example-hello .
... ...
$ docker push secondstate/rust-example-hello
```
